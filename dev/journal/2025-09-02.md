## S1-GIT — Cleanup of Large Files & Push Fix

**Why:** GitHub push blocked due to >100MB files in `.pnpm-store` (e.g., 137MB, 114MB)

**Steps:**
- Identified `.pnpm-store` accidentally committed to Git history
- Installed `git-filter-repo` via `pip3` to surgically remove it
- Ran cleanup:  
  `git filter-repo --path .pnpm-store --invert-paths --force`
- Re-added remote:  
  `git remote add origin git@github.com:enepac/basalang.git`
- Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub:  
  `git push origin phase/1 --force`

**Outcome:**  
✅ Push succeeded  
✅ Repo now clean and under GitHub size limits  
✅ Safe for future development and clones
